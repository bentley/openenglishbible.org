      <title>Welcome to the Open English Bible</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarshipThe OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort. As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.Currently available is a preview of the Gospel of Mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are actively seeking collaboration and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>August Update</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Work continues at the Github repository. An increasing amount of infrastructure is taking shape, with the priority now being to get the underlying source of the Twentieth Century New Testament in suitable shape to build the entire NT.
The aim is that by the start of September, there will be a fully built TCNT to look at with initial updates applied to all the books.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Initial working release of NT</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/initial-working-release-nt/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2010 08:12:17 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/initial-working-release-nt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So that people can see progress, we’ve released a working release of the “Open English Bible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comprises the base Twentieth Century New Testament text with formatting applied but with only very minimal textual changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly it covers the New Testament only, with a mostly modern language and sentence structure. However, there are a number of areas in which translation choices dating from the early twentieth century would give a misleading impression to modern readers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like the New English Bible and the RSV, the TCNT deliberately retained archaic language for Old Testament quotes and direct addresses to God (which may mislead readers into believing that the distinction is present in the original text),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it used masculine gendered universals such as ‘man’ for ‘humanity’ or ‘person’ and ‘sons’ when a mixed group or ungendered referent is intended, which may mislead readers into the believing that only men were intended to be referred to, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it used bare references to ‘the Jews’ when Jewish authorities or specific groups of Jewish people were intended to be referred to, which may mislead readers as to the theological and practical relationship between early followers of Jesus and their neighbours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing these three issues is the focus of the current round of editing.
This working release can be read online, with a simple html version also available or can be downloaded as a PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of ‘release early, release often’, we’ve released a new working copy. The residual Elizabethan pronouns have been removed throughout the entire NT, and gradual improvements in language continue to be made. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updating hyphenation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the Edwardian period, hyphenation and capitalisation standards have changed. This new working version continues to improve the OEB by updating many of these nagging issues. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this working release can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/&#34;&gt;read online&lt;/a&gt;, with a simple html version &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/simple/&#34;&gt;also available&lt;/a&gt; or can be downloaded as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/downloads/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/OEB-NT-Working-3.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spelling, punctuation and gender</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/spelling-punctuation-gender/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re moving on - quality is improving as we tackle spelling and punctuation issues. Betrothal has been replaced with engagement and we bid farewell to our only usage of ‘beseech’. I beseech you: think kindly of the word as it slips into a well-earned retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well a first pass of updating gender-related language in John has been made - this means that the overly gendered language of the Edwardian era TCNT has been updated in all four gospels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this working release can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/&#34;&gt;read online&lt;/a&gt;, with a simple html version &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/simple/&#34;&gt;also available&lt;/a&gt; or can be downloaded as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/downloads/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/OEB-NT-Working-4.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt;. In a first for this release, a plain text version has been generated&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of Plain Text</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/power-of-plain-text/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to start looking at the text of the Open English Bible is with &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/blog/files/read/OEB-NT-Current.txt&#34;&gt;a copy in plain text&lt;/a&gt; (actually between you and me its valid Markdown). This also is a simple way to submit suggested changes - send me a copy of the plain text you downloaded and also a copy of your amended version. Email address is at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2011! I hope you had a great Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on the OEB continues apace. The first pass of updating gender related language now covers all four Gospels, Acts and Romans with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well, our GitHub account continues to be updated. We’ve split our rendering code into a separate repo called “USFM-Tools” with the aim that other projects will be able take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the latest build from one of the links in the sidebar!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid progress!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/rapid-progress/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/rapid-progress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a slow start to the project, we are now cooking with gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full first pass of the New Testament has been made. This includes formatting, and updating capitalisation and hyphenation; but also includes removing the TCNT’s residual Elizabethan English and modernising the use of grammatical gender in line with current mainstream translations such as the REB and the newly revised NIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still no doubt typographical errors, and proofreading is required - I’d love any such mistakes pointed out to me so they can be fixed! Email me at my address at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan now is to have a period to fix clear errors and easily fixed clunkiness in the language, then to do an official release. Why not join the project and help out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual you can read the current version of the NT from the links at the right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to help</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/how-to-help/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is always gratifying when people contact us and offer to help out with the OEB. Especially at this stage, proofreading is invaluable and we’d love all the help we can get - it is too easy to get lost in the text and overlook thing which are glaringly obvious to a new reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is always, though, how do I help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give this question a more structured answer, we’ve added a new page on the GitHub wiki. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/wiki/How-to-Help&#34;&gt;How to Help page&lt;/a&gt; sets out briefly the current workflow for the OEB, and introduces Github’s Issues mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wiki page explains that easiest way to help out is to download the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/OEB-NT-Current.txt&#34;&gt;current plain text version&lt;/a&gt; of the OEB (or read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/simple/&#34;&gt;Simple Html version&lt;/a&gt;), and look for typos, old fashioned language, inaccuracy, needed improvements etc. Then (with your GitHub account details) go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues&#34;&gt;OEB Issues Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, and add your suggested change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to keep track of suggestions - and to show you our response. It is part of our commitment to an open, transparent editing process that gives readers confidence in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping track</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/keeping-track/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New working drafts of the OEB are continually being added to this site. In this stage of the OEB’s life, we aren’t widely promoting the OEB outside of this site, so here is the place to come to find what’s new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that keeping track of the changes between working draft versions is easy. There are two main pages to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues/closed&#34;&gt;list of closed issues on Github&lt;/a&gt;. This is a list of changes which have been recommended (why not recommend one yourself?) and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/commits/master&#34;&gt;commit history&lt;/a&gt; - every change goes here, small or large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not only a handy way to keep up to date, but also part of our commitment to you - to be open and transparent in all of our translation choices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The OEB moves to CC0</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/move-to-cc0/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2011 09:20:48 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/move-to-cc0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the Open English Bible was started as a project, it has been released under the Creative Commons Attribution Licence - &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&#34;&gt;CC-BY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the OEB has always been, as much as possible, to remove questions of law from the translation and publication of the Bible. At the time we started, the CC-BY licence was the freest choice. It allowed complete reuse, including (most importantly), the right to take the OEB and create your own translation embodying your own translation choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public domain declarations weren’t an option for a translation which may be used throughout the world. Many legal systems outside the US, including Australia and the UK, don’t recognise public domain declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; organisation have released their &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&#34;&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt; licence. From their &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright and other laws throughout the world automatically extend copyright protection to works of authorship and databases, whether the author or creator wants those rights or not. CC0 gives those who want to give up those rights a way to do so, to the fullest extent allowed by law. Once the creator or a subsequent owner of a work applies CC0 to a work, the work is no longer his or hers in any meaningful sense under copyright law. Anyone can then use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, subject to other laws and the rights others may have in the work or how the work is used. Think of CC0 as the &amp;ldquo;no rights reserved&amp;rdquo; option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perfect for the OEB, and after some thought the OEB is moving from the old CC-BY licence and adopting &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&#34;&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Issues in translation: Matt 6:22-23</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/matt-622/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/matt-622/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current draft of the OEB, Matthew 6:22-23 reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up; but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a bad translation. The eternal question is whether we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Chambers has suggested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues#issue/22&#34;&gt;Issue 22&lt;/a&gt; that we reconsider - if you are interested, why not join us on the current discussion on &lt;a href=&#34;http://betterbibles.com/2011/03/10/matt-622-23/&#34;&gt;BetterBibles.com&lt;/a&gt; on this very verse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Main OEB now uses US spelling</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/main-oeb-us-spelling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/main-oeb-us-spelling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The base on which the OEB is built, the groundbreaking ‘20th Century New Testament’, was the labour of love of a number of English translators at the turn of the century. As as result, the OEB up until now has used Oxford spelling - words such as realise, Saviour and, well, labour abounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the position of the US as the largest English speaking community (at least as a first language), it has long been our intent to have the OEB primarily in US spelling, with a Commonwealth spelling version also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the work of Tim Chambers, we now have moved our primary version of the OEB (the one linked to on the right) to US spelling. We haven’t forgotten the non-US world, though, and will soon release a better mechanism for downloading the OEB in whichever spelling you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
