Although things may appear on the surface to be moving slowly, progress continues on improving the Open English Bible. From now on, when books from the Old Testament are considered to be in a suitable state for wider reading, they will be linked to from the front page in PDF form. 

So far, the Psalms and the book of Ruth have been added, but more are in the pipeline.

As before, drafts can be found on our development page. These haven’t yet been checked as consistently as the New Testament, so although they should be free of typos and translation errors, you should check them yourselves before relying on them.

As well, we have updated to the latest version of John Dyer’s Bible Browser software. This great software is now available as Open Source on [Github](https://github.com/digitalbiblesociety/browserbible) - congratulations, John!
