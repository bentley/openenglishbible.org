<p>As we move into updating Hosea, now is a good time to set out some general principles that the updating will follow.

<p>This post is in effect a summary of the translation philosophy for the Open English Bible. It doesn't cover everything but sets out the overall approach.

<h2>Aims</h2>

<ol>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">The Open English Bible project aims to create a translation of the Bible into formal but contemporary English which is completely free of copyright restrictions and available without cost for any purpose.</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">In general, the OEB aims:

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
 
        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">to be a scholarly defensible mainstream translation usable within a religious community rather than a translation focused on a readership completely unfamiliar with the Bible or Christianity (as an example, the OEB is comfortable with the word ‘Christ’ and will not replace them with ‘Annointed One’ or similar),</li>

        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">to reflect modern English usage (including the use of ‘they’ as a third person single pronoun) at a reading level corresponding roughly to the NEB/REB or NRSV,</li>

        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">to reflect modern scholarship, including on the translation of terms such as ‘the Jews’ in John and terms referring to sexual practices (see TNIV and Dr Ann Nyland’s version).</li>

        </ol>

    </li>

</ol>

<h2>Underlying Texts</h2>

<ol>

    <li value="3" style="margin: 10pt 0;">The normative text for the OEB New Testament is the Westcott & Hort critical text. (Since the NA27/28 is subject to a claim of copyright, W&H remains the best available public domain text.) The commonly accepted Western non-interpolations in the NT are included as footnotes. The Pericope Adulterae is at John 7:53-8:11 and footnoted as not being in all manuscripts.</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">The normative text for the OEB Old Testament is the Masoretic Text as found in the Codex Leningradensis (Leningrad Codex), specifically the electronic version of the Westminster Leningrad Codex. Alternate readings found in the LXX, Peshitta or Dead Sea Scolls may be footnoted if appropriate but are secondary.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Guidelines for Translators</h2>

<ol>

    <li value="5" style="margin: 10pt 0;">Resulting English should be clear, grammatically correct, modern (but not slang) and genre-sensitive (i.e. we have more latitude in poetry).</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">Unless there is a good reason, keep within the scope of the various translation choices of the mainstream English translations, e.g. NRSV/ESV, NEB/REB, (T)NIV, TEV, CEV, CEB, NJB, NET, NLT(2nd Ed), HCSB etc.</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">All things being equal, prefer:

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">the existing wording from the underlying English base text (ie the 20CNT, Kent or McFadyen),</li>

        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">the non-Tyndale (i.e. the KJV/RV/ESV/WEB/NRSV family) option. This is just to keep us from falling into the trap of slowly converting the OEB into the NRSV/ESV bit by bit.</li>

        <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">the rendering which is simpler (i.e. shorter less complicated sentence structures, less use of passive voice etc). But don't turn poetry into an instruction manual!</li>

        </ol>

    </li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">Walk a midline between translating Greek/Hebrew idioms into contemporary idioms or translating more literally, but prefer something which will communicate the meaning to someone who doesn't already know the passage's meaning. Don't be too current or trendy. Generally:

        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">

	       <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">a 'word-for-word' approach that doesn’t end up with natural, gramatically normal English has gone too far, (see e.g. Young’s Literal Version)</li>

	       <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">a 'thought-for-thought' approach that destroys too much of the worldview of the original has also gone too far (see e.g. the Message, or the Cotton Patch Version)</li>

       </ol>

    </li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">The OEB uses the following: Christ, baptize, Gehenna, Tartarus. The Tetragrammaton is rendered as the LORD in small caps.</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">The NRSV is the authoritative source for English language versions of proper names including personal and place names.</li>

    <li style="margin: 10pt 0;">Following Eric Blair's wise words, break any of these rules rather than say something outright barbarous.</li>

</ol>
