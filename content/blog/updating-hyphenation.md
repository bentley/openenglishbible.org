Since the Edwardian period, hyphenation and capitalisation standards have changed. This new working version continues to improve the OEB by updating many of these nagging issues. Check it out!

As usual, this working release can be [read online](http://openenglishbible.org/read/), with a simple html version [also available](http://openenglishbible.org/read/simple/) or can be downloaded as a [PDF file](http://github.com/downloads/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/OEB-NT-Working-3.pdf).
