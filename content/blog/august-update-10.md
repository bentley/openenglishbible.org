Work continues at the Github repository. An increasing amount of infrastructure is taking shape, with the priority now being to get the underlying source of the Twentieth Century New Testament in suitable shape to build the entire NT.
The aim is that by the start of September, there will be a fully built TCNT to look at with initial updates applied to all the books.
