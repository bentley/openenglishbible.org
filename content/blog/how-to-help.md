It is always gratifying when people contact us and offer to help out with the OEB. Especially at this stage, proofreading is invaluable and we’d love all the help we can get - it is too easy to get lost in the text and overlook thing which are glaringly obvious to a new reader.

The question is always, though, how do I help?

To give this question a more structured answer, we’ve added a new page on the GitHub wiki. The [How to Help page](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/wiki/How-to-Help) sets out briefly the current workflow for the OEB, and introduces Github’s Issues mechanism.

The wiki page explains that easiest way to help out is to download the [current plain text version](http://openenglishbible.org/read/OEB-NT-Current.txt) of the OEB (or read the [Simple Html version](http://openenglishbible.org/read/simple/)), and look for typos, old fashioned language, inaccuracy, needed improvements etc. Then (with your GitHub account details) go to the [OEB Issues Tracker](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues), and add your suggested change!

This allows us to keep track of suggestions - and to show you our response. It is part of our commitment to an open, transparent editing process that gives readers confidence in the final product.
