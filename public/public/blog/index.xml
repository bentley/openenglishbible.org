      <title>Refreshing the OEB website</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/refresh-website/</link>

      <guid>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/refresh-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The OEB website has become a little bit, um, venerable over the last couple of years. Although it was always clean and simple, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t up to date with the latest responsive designs needed for the large numbers of people reading on their mobile phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the time was right for a refresh. The design has stayed mostly the same, but the site itself is now built using &lt;a href=&#34;http://foundation.zurb.com/&#34;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and all the sources are hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/openenglishbible.org&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; - so if you have improvements (or just find the inevitable speling mistake) then you can help us fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you like it! Stay tuned for more updates&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OEB (2014.11) - &#39;Julia E Smith&#39; Release</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/new-release-14/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/new-release-14/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce a new release of the OEB, including the New Testament and Psalms and available from the front page of the Open English Bible website at &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org&#34;&gt;http://openenglishbible.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release is the first in a line of releases to include more books from the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. In this release we have included Ruth, and Esther.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have dedicated this release to Julia Evelina Smith (1792-1886) whose translation of the Bible was the first translation of the entire Bible by a woman. Julia was a suffragette, from an nonconformist and abolitionist family in Connecticut. Her preface to her translation, published in 1876, begins: “It may seem presumptuous for an ordinary woman with no particular advantages of education to translate and publish alone, the most wonderful book that has ever appeared in the world, and thought to be the most difficult to translate.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Release of Open English Bible</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/new-release-13/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to announce a new release of the OEB, including the New Testament and Psalms and available from the front page of the Open English Bible website at &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/&#34;&gt;http://openenglishbible.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release is part of our new release policy. We aim to put out a new revision of the OEB four times a year - roughly January, April, July, October. Yes, we are a little bit late this release :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fast release cycle is in line with a saying from the Open Source software world - “release early and release often” - and because we’ve been doing some great work preparing more books from the Old Testament, and revising the New Testament and want to get that work out for people to look at and comment on. Stick with us and we promise great things are in the pipeline!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Work on the OEB is done in the open - you can follow it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; (if you are geeky), on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.openenglishbible.org/&#34;&gt;mailing list/forum&lt;/a&gt; and on a regular basis we try to build a development version. These development versions have books in them which aren’t yet ready for wide release, so they’re not appropriate for a worship or study context. But if you want to keep track of what’s happening, or want to help out, then why not go to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/development/&#34;&gt;development page&lt;/a&gt;, join the forum and help build a new type of Bible translation!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New New Testament by Hal Taussig</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/new-new-testament/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;blogpic&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/img/new-new-testament.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A New New Testament book cover&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

The OEB has from the start been intended to be more than just another translation. We anticipate it being the base for many translations. The text of the OEB is as free from restriction as we can make it, so that anyone can take it and use it as their own beliefs and conscience dictate — without requiring our permission or approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging with the Bible means more than just reading an approved translation made by others. It also means translating it into our heart languages, sharing stories and lessons with each other, exploring depth and shades which single standard English phrasings colour over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first fruits of this policy has reached the bookstores. Hal Taussig, a pastor and early Christianity scholar, has put together a book which includes a reworking of the OEB New Testament by his translation team in the context of other non-canonical writings from the early Christian communities. The author hopes this will give fresh insights where repetition and familiarity may have dulled us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check it out on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/New-Testament-Combining-Traditional-Discovered/dp/0547792107/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mailing list and forum</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/mailing-list-forum/</link>

      <guid>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/mailing-list-forum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, development of the OEB has taken place by an ad-hoc network of emails. For a while the issues list on Github was being used to handle changes, but that fell into disuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these two methods is really satisfactory - emails rely too much on a single person, and the issues list was too constraining in terms of conversations, and didn’t provide the human interaction that it vital for a proper community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to fix this and to grow the active part of the OEB community, there is now a new mailing list and Nabble forum at &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.openenglishbible.org/&#34;&gt;forum.openenglishbible.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you have ever wanted to contribute your time and effort then please join up. There is plenty of available work for people of all skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although things may appear on the surface to be moving slowly, progress continues on improving the Open English Bible. From now on, when books from the Old Testament are considered to be in a suitable state for wider reading, they will be linked to from the front page in PDF form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the Psalms and the book of Ruth have been added, but more are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, drafts can be found on our development page. These haven’t yet been checked as consistently as the New Testament, so although they should be free of typos and translation errors, you should check them yourselves before relying on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well, we have updated to the latest version of John Dyer’s Bible Browser software. This great software is now available as Open Source on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/digitalbiblesociety/browserbible&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; - congratulations, John!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Christmas to you all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks for everyone’s support and help throughout the year. It is because of that help that we have moved to the absolutely free CC0 licence, have made many improvements to the New Testament, started on a translation of the Book of Psalms and have created modules for Bible study software such as TheWord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May your Christmas celebrations be full of joy and happiness!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OEB module for TheWord software!</title>

      <title>Psalms</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/psalms/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Work continues apace on improving the naturalness and accuracy of the OEB translation of the New Testament. As well, we are working on providing the OEB in more formats, including formats such as TheWord and Sword modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it has always been the aim of the OEB project to move beyond the New Testament and a number of options have been investigated over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is to announce that a preliminary translation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/oeb/current/OEB-Psalms-Current-Cth.pdf&#34;&gt;the Book of Psalms is available for download as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The translation is a revision of a 1919 translation by a Scottish Old Testament scholar called John Edgar McFadyen. More information on it is available in the preface of the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As yet, a final decision hasn’t been made on whether to fold this into the OEB as our official version of the Psalms. Considerable advances have been made in proofreading and checking the version for accuracy but much remains to be done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a Commonwealth spelling version is available so far, with a US spelling version a priority for future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the NT, the OEB Psalms are available under a CC0 (public domain) licence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who is reading the OEB?</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/who-is-reading-oeb/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/who-is-reading-oeb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a new and so far low-key endeavour, the Open English Bible is slowly attracting readers and helpers. Although we can’t tell exactly how the OEB is being used, the statistics from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/&#34;&gt;openenglishbible.org site&lt;/a&gt; can give us a feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last month, the website had 812 visits from 630 visitors, which were overwhelmingly new visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 350 of them checked out the OEB on the online reader, there were 245 downloads of the pdf for offline reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there appears to be roughly the same interest in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/OEB-NT-Cth-Current.pdf&#34;&gt;Commonwealth spelling version&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/read/OEB-NT-US-Current.pdf&#34;&gt;US one&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), with about 100 downloads of the Commonwealth spelling version against 150 of the US version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors came from all over the world - the US unsurprisingly as the largest, but the top ten were: USA, Russia, then India, Philippines, Canada, Nigeria, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Pakistan. It is great to see the spread of interest: there were visitors from over 103 countries (though the UK was lagging behind at number 17 - come on guys!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although people who run well used websites will think these figures a low starting point, every download of the OEB is very gratifying and humbling. The figures are also rising steadily, month on month. We are also slowly attracting visitors and friends at our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-English-Bible/191330814219131&#34;&gt;facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move towards improving the OEB New Testament language, and adding more books from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, we will be also moving towards more aggressively marketing the OEB. When that happens we can expect a large increase in the readership. It will be interesting to see how these early statistics match up when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translating τῶν Ἰουδαίων in the Open English Bible</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/hoi-ioudaioi/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/hoi-ioudaioi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The translation of this term, which appears in the King James Version as &amp;lsquo;the Jews&amp;rsquo;, is difficult and sensitive. The mind of the modern reader is different to that of the initial readers of John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel and of Acts. We read in the context of our culture and our history, just as the early readers of the Gospel of John read in the light of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our commitment to be open and transparent in the translation choices we are making, I’ve written this post to explain how the OEB project deals with this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much thought, we have chosen to listen to the advice of such translators as Barclay Newman and David Burke (see the Bibliography below) and have committed to the GitHub repository changes which represent an adoption of the suggestions of Newman (2005) after comparison with the most recent edition of the NIV (2011), the New Living Translation (NLT), Contemporary English Version (CEV) and other translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes represent an awareness of the truth of the statement of Burke (1993) that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”The problem is not how well the English locution reflects the Greek text or the escalating polemical realities of the first century situation, but rather its effect on the (poorly informed) modern reader.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Newman (1996):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”I am thoroughly convinced that it was never the intention of any New Testament writer to perpetuate anti-Jewish sentiments that would ultimately result in either discrimination against or persecution of the Jewish community in the course of history. One has only to listen to the apostle Paul: “I would gladly be placed under God’s curse and be separated from Christ for the good of my own people” (Romans 9:3). In the many New Testament passages (especially in John and Acts) where the phrase “the Jews” occurs, a literal rendering has historically resulted in arousing negative reactions that were not intended by the authors of these documents. Whatever the response of the authors to their particular conflict with certain segments of the Jewish community, it was never their intention to perpetuate 20 centuries of anti-Jewish feelings.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with this and the views of Motyer (1994) and others. I disagree with the view that the Gospel of John was intended to contain in itself a hatred of those Jews who did not join the early Church - the view that the author of John has intentionally and anachronistically placed bitter disputes of his time back into the time (and mouth) of Jesus. My position is that later anti-Semitism is not a valid continuation of the text’s intent but is instead a distortion of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must always keep in mind when determining what the author of the Gospel of John intends to say when he wrote &amp;lsquo;τῶν Ἰουδαίων&amp;rsquo; that both the author and his readers knew and understood that all of the participants in the drama were Jews, including Jesus and his apostles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If translation is at least in part the attempt to have the translated text have a similar effect on the mind of the reader as the initial text had on the minds of the first listeners, to communicate to today’s readers what the original communicated to the original readers, then adopting the readings committed to GitHub creates, I have come to believe, a more accurate translation than one which is more &amp;lsquo;literal&amp;rsquo; but is nevertheless (no doubt unintentionally) misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is clear that not only does the repeated translation of &amp;ldquo;τῶν Ἰουδαίων&amp;rdquo; as &amp;lsquo;the Jews&amp;rsquo; have the &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; to mislead readers into thinking it is the intent of the writer of John to apply corporate blame for the persecution and death of Jesus to the Jewish people as a whole, but that the use of the phrase in previous translations has as &lt;em&gt;a matter of historical fact&lt;/em&gt; led to precisely that misunderstanding, with tragic and horrific consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A translation is a bad translation if it leads to readers suspecting that the author of the Gospel of John would have had sympathy for or would have supported the historical treatment of Jews by Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a reminder, although I believe the choices I have made are the correct ones, you are free, as always, to create your own version of the Open English Bible without this or any other set of changes. That freedom is the intent of the OEB&amp;rsquo;s CC0 licence and the reason for the OEB’s existence.&amp;ndash; Russell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some further reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare the translation choice of the CEV, NLT, CEB, NET, TEV and NIV2011.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OEB now in both US and Commonwealth English</title>
      <link>http://openenglishbible.org/blog/cth-and-us-english/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the OEB started, it was based on the Twentieth Century New Testament, the translators of which were as English as, well, English people. The OEB started out, therefore, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling&#34;&gt;Oxford Spelling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the changes that was made was to create a version of the OEB for readers who are used to the way words are commonly spelt in the United States, but we always had a plan to make both versions available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you go the “&lt;a href=&#34;http://openenglishbible.org/get/&#34;&gt;Get&lt;/a&gt;” page on this site, you can download (in PDF, Text or Word format) the OEB in either US spelling or Commonwealth spelling for those readers outside the US. Hello again to Australia, Canada, Nigeria, the UK, New Zealand, Ireland, India, Kenya, Jamaica, Tuvalu and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_English_is_an_official_language&#34;&gt;all the other English speaking countries&lt;/a&gt;! The OEB-Cth spelling version retains the Oxford spelling ‘ize’ endings to appropriate words in line with the standard English used by the UN and the Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two interesting blog posts on copyright and the Bible have been put up, the first by David Ker of FutureBible: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://futurebible.org/2011/bible-copyrights-are-not-evil/&#34;&gt;Bible Copyrights Aren’t Evil&lt;/a&gt;”, and the second by Peter Kirk of Gentle Wisdom, “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gentlewisdom.org.uk/3418/love-of-bible-copyright-is-a-root-of-all-kinds-of-evil/&#34;&gt;Love of Bible copyright is a root of all kinds of evil&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to read them both. My viewpoint, as might be expected, is that we should renounce our copyrights in our translations as the OEB does. As I wrote on David’s site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Even a liberal licence gives the owner of the copyright power over the text. It tempts them to restrict use of the text to extract badly needed money (this isn’t an accusation of greed!) or to keep the text safe from bad influences. The desired outcome is good, but the mechanism is risky. It historically leads to the powerful determining what the powerless can make their Bible look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has already translations full of all sorts of egregious errors, distortions and theologically driven misinterpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are certainly many current public domain translations out there which fail the trust test.
But this is the price we pay for the freedom to seek the truth ourselves – to approach the Bible without requiring permission, licence or payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should encourage good translations and warn against errors, but not seek to use the power of the State to enforce our (merely human) opinions.*&lt;/p&gt;
