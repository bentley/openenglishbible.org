The easiest way to start looking at the text of the Open English Bible is with [a copy in plain text](http://openenglishbible.org/blog/files/read/OEB-NT-Current.txt) (actually between you and me its valid Markdown). This also is a simple way to submit suggested changes - send me a copy of the plain text you downloaded and also a copy of your amended version. Email address is at the bottom of the page.
