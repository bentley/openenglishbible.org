	<div class="meta"><small>Dec 22, 2018</small></div>
	

<h2 id="about-hosea">About Hosea</h2>

<p>One of the earliest of the prophetic books, Hosea  has 14 chapters, with versification in the NRSV and JPS differing towards the beginning and end.</p>

<h2 id="hebrew-source">Hebrew Source</h2>

<p>As for the rest of the OEB Hebrew Bible, we are using the Masoretic Text as found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex">Leningrad Codex</a> and transcribed in the <a href="https://www.grovescenter.org/projects/westminster-leningrad-codex/">Westminster Leningrad Codex</a>.</p>

<p>However, as the NET Bible translators note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The textual problems in Hosea are virtually unparalleled in the OT. The Masoretic Text (MT), represented by the Leningrad Codex (c. A.D. 1008), which served as the basis for both BHK and BHS, and the Aleppo Codex (c. A.D. 952), are textually corrupt by all accounts and have a multitude of scribal errors. Many medieval Masoretic MSS preserve textual variants that differ from the Leningrad and Aleppo Codices. The Qumran materials (4QXIIc,d,g) contain numerous textual variants that differ from the MT; unfortunately, these texts are quite fragmentary (frequently in the very place that an important textual problem appears). The textual tradition and translation quality of the LXX and the early Greek recensions (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion) is mixed; in some places they are inferior to the MT but in other places they preserve a better reading. The textual apparatus of BHK and BHS contains many proposed emendations based on the ancient versions (Greek, Syriac, Latin, Aramaic) that often appear to be superior readings than what is preserved in the MT. In numerous cases, the MT readings are so difficult morphologically, syntactically, and contextually that conservative conjectural emendations are necessary to make sense of the text. Most major English versions (e.g., KJV, ASV, RSV, NEB, NAB, NASB, NIV, TEV, NKJV, NJPS, NJB, NRSV, REB, NCV, CEV, NLT) adopt (either occasionally or frequently) textual variants reflected in the versions and occasionally adopt conservative conjectural emendations proposed in BHK and/or BHS. However, many of the textual problems in Hosea are so difficult that the English versions frequently are split among themselves. With this in mind, the present translation of Hosea must necessarily be viewed as only preliminary. Further work on the text and translation of Hosea is needed, not only in terms of the NET BIBLE but in Hosea studies in general. <a href="https://netbible.org/bible/Hosea+1">NET Bible notes</a></p>

<h2 id="base-english-translation">Base English Translation</h2>

<p>As for the other books of the Bible, we are using a base English translation which is in the public domain and editing it, rather than starting from scratch. This has proven to be a great time-saver and without it, the OEB would likely be impossible.</p>

<p>For Hosea, as for many of our other books from the Old Testament, we are using a translation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Foster_Kent">Charles Foster Kent</a> (1867 - 1925), who was Wolsey Professor of Biblical Literature at Yale. He translated the various books of the Hebrew Bible a number of times for differing audiences, for Hosea the relevant volume is <a href="https://archive.org/details/studentsoldtesta03kent">Student&rsquo;s Old Testament: Sermons, Epistles and Apocalypses of Israel&rsquo;s Prophets</a> (1910).</p>

<p>Professor Kent&rsquo;s work has many of the obvious defects of the scholarship of his era, however it is the work of a serious scholar and is less deliberately anachronistic and tied to traditional renderings than contemporaneous translations such as the American Standard Version (1901) and Jewish Publication Society Version (1917).</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next step in the process is to turn the base English translation into USFM, and commit it to our Git repository. At the time of writing, this is about half done. After than, we turn to updating it to become part of the OEB.</p>

	       <p><h2><a href="https://openenglishbible.org/blog/2018-reboot/"> Rebooting the OEB project</a></h2>
	<div class="meta"><small>Dec 1, 2018</small></div>
	

<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="/img/scribe.jpg">We&rsquo;re back&hellip; You may have noticed that activity has been a little slow over the last year. Partly that has been because the changes we&rsquo;ve been making are less public (changes to backend software etc) but it is also because progress did actually stall for a while.</p>

<p>As of December 2018, the OEB is &lsquo;rebooted&rsquo; - we&rsquo;re back and you should now see regular updates as we push towards an initial release of all the books of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

<p>The last release of the OEB, <em>&lsquo;2016.1&rsquo;</em>, contained all the New Testament books, the book of Psalms and a miscellaneous collection of the Old Testament, being Ruth and Esther, and most of the Minor Prophets except for Amos and Hosea.</p>

<p>There are a number of other books which have initial drafts which aren&rsquo;t yet ready to release. Of these Genesis is the furthest along.</p>

<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>

<p>The main plan is to bring much of the work which is being done behind the scenes back into the open. Expect much more regular updates on this blog and on the mailing list, showing how the translation and checking is progressing.</p>

<h2 id="one-step-at-a-time">One Step at a Time</h2>

<p>We are going to work on the books of the Old Testament / Hebrew Bible more or less in reverse order using the Protestant ordering.</p>

<p>That is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, we will finish the Twelve. These are all done except for Hosea and Amos.</p></li>

<li><p>Second, we&rsquo;ll move to the Major Prophets, releasing Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel and Daniel.</p></li>

<li><p>Thirdly, the Wisdom Books. We have already released the Psalms, but will work on Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon.</p></li>

<li><p>Fourthly, a History lesson. We aready have Ruth and Esther, but we will fill in the rest of the stories of the conquest of Canaan, the period of the judges and the united and divided monarchies. Of these, 1 Samuel is already is good shape.</p></li>

<li><p>And lastly, we will tackle the five books of the Law / Torah. Genesis is in not too bad shape already, but work hasn&rsquo;t started yet on the other four books.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At each stage, the process will be to release, on a regular basis, the chapters which have been completed. When the book is finished to a first, but releasable, version, a new numbered OEB will be pushed to the website.</p>

<h2 id="technicalities">Technicalities</h2>

<p>All of the source to the OEB is in usfm.db files in the /source directory on the <a href="https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Each book of the Bible has a file, which is a USFM file marked up to maintain multiple different varients within the same file (for example, to contain both the US and UK spelling varieties).</p>

<p>At any stage, the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch contains the sources of books which have been released, and the various artifacts (usfm, epub, pdf etc) which have been built from them.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;dev&rsquo; branch contains all of the sources, released and in development, and word processing files (.rtf) of each book, whether finished or not. Please don&rsquo;t take and use these materials outside the context of the OEB project! They will necessarily be broken and wrong in part.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-existing-books">Changes to existing books</h2>

<p>Until we have a first release of the complete Old and New Testaments, focus will definately be on the not yet finished books. However we are still interested in improvements to the already &lsquo;done&rsquo; books, in particular:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fixes to obvious spelling, grammar or other errors.</p></li>

<li><p>Fixes to uncontentious, egregious translation errors (hopefully we don&rsquo;t have too many of these!)</p></li>

<li><p>Other clear improvements. However unless you are prepared to help us by doing most of the necessary work to incoporate these into the OEB, we may need to park these for consideration after we have a full release of the full Bible.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-help">How to Help</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;d love to have you as part of the OEB journey. If you have knowldge and experience in translation or have any questions then please contact Russell Allen <a href="mailto:oebible@openenglishbible.org">oebible@openenglishbible.org</a> and join the mailing list.</p>

<p>Specifically you can help by:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reading each section being currently translated as it is posted here and discussing it on the mailing list.</p></li>

<li><p>Letting us know about any spelling, grammar or egregious translation errors you come across when reading the OEB.</p></li>
</ol>
