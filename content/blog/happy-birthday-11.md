The OEB project was started one year ago when we bought our domain names and started on the work of turning the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament into a CC0 licenced modern, clear and expressive English translation.

So happy birthday to us! And many thanks to all of the great people who have helped us on the way, whether by contributing on the Github issues page, emailing suggestions, or just expressing support for what weâ€™re trying to achieve.

I have really high hopes for the OEB in the next year. The quality of the OEB just continues to rise thanks to readers contributing suggestions and fixes, and I fully expect that we will start publicising the OEB New Testament much more widely in the next few months.

Stay tuned for more ways to download and read the OEB, and also for discussions on our plans to expand into the Old Testament.
