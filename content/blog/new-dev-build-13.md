Work on the OEB is done in the open - you can follow it on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible) (if you are geeky), on the [mailing list/forum](http://forum.openenglishbible.org/) and on a regular basis we try to build a development version. These development versions have books in them which aren’t yet ready for wide release, so they’re not appropriate for a worship or study context. But if you want to keep track of what’s happening, or want to help out, then why not go to the [development page](http://openenglishbible.org/development/), join the forum and help build a new type of Bible translation!
