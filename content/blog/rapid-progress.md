After a slow start to the project, we are now cooking with gas.

A full first pass of the New Testament has been made. This includes formatting, and updating capitalisation and hyphenation; but also includes removing the TCNT’s residual Elizabethan English and modernising the use of grammatical gender in line with current mainstream translations such as the REB and the newly revised NIV.

There are still no doubt typographical errors, and proofreading is required - I’d love any such mistakes pointed out to me so they can be fixed! Email me at my address at the bottom of the page.

The plan now is to have a period to fix clear errors and easily fixed clunkiness in the language, then to do an official release. Why not join the project and help out?

As usual you can read the current version of the NT from the links at the right.
