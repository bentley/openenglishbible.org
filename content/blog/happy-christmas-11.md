Happy Christmas to you all!

And thanks for everyoneâ€™s support and help throughout the year. It is because of that help that we have moved to the absolutely free CC0 licence, have made many improvements to the New Testament, started on a translation of the Book of Psalms and have created modules for Bible study software such as TheWord. 

May your Christmas celebrations be full of joy and happiness!
