For a while now, development of the OEB has taken place by an ad-hoc network of emails. For a while the issues list on Github was being used to handle changes, but that fell into disuse. 

Neither of these two methods is really satisfactory - emails rely too much on a single person, and the issues list was too constraining in terms of conversations, and didnâ€™t provide the human interaction that it vital for a proper community.

In an effort to fix this and to grow the active part of the OEB community, there is now a new mailing list and Nabble forum at [forum.openenglishbible.org](http://forum.openenglishbible.org/). If you have ever wanted to contribute your time and effort then please join up. There is plenty of available work for people of all skills and knowledge.
