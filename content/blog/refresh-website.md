The OEB website has become a little bit, um, venerable over the last couple of years. Although it was always clean and simple, it wasn't up to date with the latest responsive designs needed for the large numbers of people reading on their mobile phones and tablets.

So the time was right for a refresh. The design has stayed mostly the same, but the site itself is now built using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and all the sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/openenglishbible/openenglishbible.org) - so if you have improvements (or just find the inevitable speling mistake) then you can help us fix it.

We hope you like it! Stay tuned for more updates...
