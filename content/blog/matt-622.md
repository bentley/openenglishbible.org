In the current draft of the OEB, Matthew 6:22-23 reads:

*The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up; but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be!*

This is not a bad translation. The eternal question is whether we can do better. 

Tim Chambers has suggested in [Issue 22](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues#issue/22) that we reconsider - if you are interested, why not join us on the current discussion on [BetterBibles.com](http://betterbibles.com/2011/03/10/matt-622-23/) on this very verse.
