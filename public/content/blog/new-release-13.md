We’re pleased to announce a new release of the OEB, including the New Testament and Psalms and available from the front page of the Open English Bible website at [http://openenglishbible.org](http://openenglishbible.org/)

This release is part of our new release policy. We aim to put out a new revision of the OEB four times a year - roughly January, April, July, October. Yes, we are a little bit late this release :)

This fast release cycle is in line with a saying from the Open Source software world - “release early and release often” - and because we’ve been doing some great work preparing more books from the Old Testament, and revising the New Testament and want to get that work out for people to look at and comment on. Stick with us and we promise great things are in the pipeline!
