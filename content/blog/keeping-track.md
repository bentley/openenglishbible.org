New working drafts of the OEB are continually being added to this site. In this stage of the OEB’s life, we aren’t widely promoting the OEB outside of this site, so here is the place to come to find what’s new.

The good news is that keeping track of the changes between working draft versions is easy. There are two main pages to keep an eye on.

The first is the [list of closed issues on Github](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues/closed). This is a list of changes which have been recommended (why not recommend one yourself?) and implemented.

The second is the [commit history](https://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/commits/master) - every change goes here, small or large.

This is not only a handy way to keep up to date, but also part of our commitment to you - to be open and transparent in all of our translation choices.
