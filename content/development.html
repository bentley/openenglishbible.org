<h1>Development</h1>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>All of the raw sources for the OEB are developed as USFM files on the <a href="http://github.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible">git repository at GitHub</a>. Unless you are familiar with USFM and Git, you may want to look at the MS Word documents linked below.
  
<h2>Forum</h2>

<p>Discussion about the development, and the OEB project in general, happens on the forum. You can access the forum either from the <a href="http://forum.openenglishbible.org">web archive</a> or as a mailing list. Details on how to sign up are at the archive.</p>

<h2>Development Status</h2>

<p>This is the development page for the Open English Bible. Each book is here, with links to Word docx files and to the original marked up USFM on Github. Books are marked as being <span class="absent">absent</span>, <span class="partial">partial</span>, <span class="unchecked">unchecked</span>, <span class="checked">checked</span>, <span class="released">released</span>. Unless the book has been released (and is in the main build) please treat it with caution as it probably contains errors. In particular, books marked <span class="partial">partial</span> or <span class="unchecked">unchecked</span> could contain almost anything, including missing verses, egregious translation errors and disparaging references to penguins.</p>

<p>If you would like to help out, the steps are first to join the forum, then secondly to help check one of the books not yet in release.</p>
