TheWord software is a great Bible study program for Windows available without cost from [www.theword.net](http://www.theword.net/) with a number of translations, dictionaries and tools available both for free and commercially. The OEB is now available as a free module for TheWord - [download it now](http://www.theword.net/index.php?downloads.modules&l=english) for either US or Commonwealth spelling! Many thanks go to Martin for his hard word in the conversion and to Costas from TheWord for his help in making this available.
